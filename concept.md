# Weather Pipeline

This project aims to integrate the technologies learnt during the bootcamp and through certifications into a deliverable application.  
In doing so, I gain practical experience.  

## Domain

The domain of this project is be descriptive & predictive analytics for weather.
More specifically, real-time weather information and current day predictions.

## Value

By taking a quick glance at the dashboard, the consumer will be able to retrieve insights regarding the weather for the day.  
It is easily extentable with modules.

## Goals

Create a basic pipeline which retrieves data on weather through an API, processes it, stores it and delivers it to a dashboard.

## Functional Requirements

The application code itself should be programmed in Scala.  
The pipeline should be completely cloud-based (Microsoft Azure).  
The data processing should be done using Apache Spark.  
The infrastructure for this pipeline should be constructed through Terraform.  

## Non-functional Requirements

Security:  
All secrets should be stored in the cloud.  

Cost:  
Cloud costs should be kept to a minimum. Budgets & estimations are included to prevent cost issues.  

Documentation:  
The project should be well-documented.
