# Weather Pipeline

This project aims to integrate the technologies learnt during the bootcamp and through certifications into a deliverable application.
In doing so, practical experience will be gained.

## Domain

The domain of this project will be descriptive & predictive analytics for weather.
More specifically, real-time weather information and current day predictions.

## Value

By taking a quick glance at the dashboard, the consumer will be able to retrieve insights regarding the weather for the day.
For example, knowing what clothing to wear and whether it will rain or not.
Once the fundaments have been developed, it should be able to be easily extended with modules containing extra information.

## Goals

Create a basic pipeline which retrieves data on weather through an API, processes it, stores it and delivers it to a dashboard.
Use a multitude of cloud services

## Functional Requirements

The application code itself should be programmed in Scala.
The pipeline should be completely cloud-based (Microsoft Azure).
The data processing should be done using Apache Spark.
The infrastructure for this pipeline should be constructed through Terraform.
The final application should be containerised with Docker.

## Non-functional Requirements

Security: All configuration secrets should be stored in the cloud.

Cost: Cloud costs should be kept to a minimum. Budgets & estimations are included to prevent cost issues.
